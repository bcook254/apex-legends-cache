# apex-legends-cache

## What does this file do?
The first time a new player on Linux tries to play Apex Legends it can be a horrible experience. From occasional stuttering when a new shader is cached, to complete freezes and crashes as hundred or thousands of new shaders a processed. These problems also plague long time Apex Legends on Linux players as each new map update has a huge impact on game performance requiring re-rendering of shaders. This repository will hopefully become a large community effort to make Apex Legends on Linux a smooth and enjoyable experience for everyone.

## Why do we need this?
Apex Legends uses the Direct3D 11 rendering engine which is not supported on Linux. Instead, Proton uses DXVK to provide a Vulkan-based implementation of D3D11 and 10. While this works great for most games, some have a lot of shaders that need to be accessed while you play the game. The Valve team handles most of the pre-caching of these shaders from community sourced files, but they do not distribute this one file which assists with accessing these pre-cached shaders. A more detailed explanation of what goes on behind the scenes can be found in this [r/linux\_gaming thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/t5xrho/comment/hz8bae5/).

Instead of each player having to drop in multiple times with unplayable rendering lag and stutter, we can combine the efforts of multiple Apex Legends players by combining our dxvk-cache files using the [dxvk-cache-tool](https://github.com/DarkTigrus/dxvk-cache-tool) created by [DarkTigrus](https://github.com/DarkTigrus). Lutris provides a build of this tool [here](https://lutris.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/games/overwatch/merge-tool.tar.xz).

This effort was originally started by [u/ryao](https://www.reddit.com/user/ryao/) in this [r/linux\_gaming thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/t5xrho/dxvk_state_cache_for_fixing_stutter_in_apex/). This thread worked well for a while but will eventually get lost in the history of the subreddit and may not be easy to find, especially for new players. Additionally, the history of the cache file is not readily available and cannot be quickly reverted in the event of a bad merge. This repository will also add more transparency to each merge, make it easier to give credit to each contributed, and can be more easily forked/transferred should I or any future maintainers decide to stop working on this project.

## Using this file
View the [r5apex.dxvk-cache file](https://github.com/bcook254/apex-legends-cache/blob/main/r5apex.dxvk-cache) in this repository and click the Download button in the top right hand corner. You can also use [this link](https://github.com/bcook254/apex-legends-cache/raw/main/r5apex.dxvk-cache) to directly download the file to your computer. Copy the downloaded file to your Apex Legends shadercache folder located at `/path/to/steamapps/shadercache/1172470/DXVK_state_cache/r5apex.dxvk-cache`. By default this location is `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/shadercache/1172470/DXVK_state_cache/r5apex.dxvk-cache`.

You could also clone this repository to your local machine and either manually or automatically pull each update and copy your local repository files to the same location listed above. This does require installing and setting up git and git-lfs for which there are many guides available online.

Finally, Apex Legends __MUST__ be using a Proton compatibility tool that uses __dxvk state cache file version 15__. The current cache file uses v15 and no attempts will be made to support earlier versions. As of Aug 10, 2022, __Proton Experimental__ and __GE-Proton7-27__ or later are fully compatible.

## Contributing cache files
As this is a new project, I am open to new ideas on how we can make this process easier and faster for contributors and maintainers. If you would like to propose new ideas or start a discussion around this, please open an issue.

### ⚠️Important Information⚠️
For some reason with each map change, Apex Legends no longer uses any of the previous state cache entries. This is leaving a lot of unused entries behind and creates a larger than necessary file. Therefore with each map change the current cache file will be reset and populated with new entries. This mean you __MUST__ delete your old state cache file and begin generating a new one. Submissions with old entries will be rejected if they contain these entries for the time being.

### Open an Issue
Begin by downloading the most recent version of the cache file from this repository here, [r5apex.dxvk-cache file](https://github.com/bcook254/apex-legends-cache/blob/main/r5apex.dxvk-cache), or this [direct link](https://github.com/bcook254/apex-legends-cache/raw/main/r5apex.dxvk-cache).

Next, copy your __local cache file__ in to the same folder that contains that cache file you downloaded. Assuming you are using the command line and are currently working out of said folder it might look something like this.

    cp ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/shadercache/1172470/DXVK_state_cache/r5apex.dxvk-cache ./r5apex-local.dxvk-cache

Merge the __downloaded cache file__ with your __local cache file__. Building off the previous command it should like something like this.

    dxvk-cache-tool ./r5apex.dxvk-cache ./r5apex-local.dxvk-cache

Upload the `output.dxvk-cache` generated file to your preferred location and make a publicly accessible link for it.

Open up an issue, making sure to use the __Cache File Entry__ issue template. You can also use this link, [Cache File Entry](https://github.com/bcook254/apex-legends-cache/issues/new?assignees=&labels=cache-entry&template=cache-file-entry.md&title=). __Please fill out the entire template! It makes it that much easier for me.__ ⚠️ The final number of entries added may change if a previous cache entry must be merged before merging your cache entry ⚠️

### Pull Requests
Contributors may still create pull request as described in earlier versions of this document, but it will no longer be the _preferred_ method. This method led to a lot of merge conflicts at the beginning of each map change as multiple people contribute to the project.

## Thank You!
This would not be possible without everyone who originally contributed to this file when Apex Legends first supported Linux and could not continue to be possible without each contribution and user from the community.

__Together, we will slátra our enemies.__
